Installation
============

`RUBIX` can be installed via `pip`

Clone the repository and navigate to the root directory of the repository. Then run

```
pip install .
```

Note that if `JAX` is not yet installed, only the CPU version of `JAX` will be installed
as a dependency. For a GPU-compatible installation of `JAX`, please refer to the
[JAX installation guide](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).

Get started with this simple example notebooks/rubix_pipeline_single_function.ipynb.
