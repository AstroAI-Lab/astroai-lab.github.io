    "# Concept of the pipeline\n",
    "## Basic ideas\n",
    "- rubix essentially implements a big data transformation pipeline. \n",
    "\n",
    "- a pipeline is composed of nodes that are ordered in a list ordered by execution order (or more generally a DAG [not supported currently]). Each node is called a transformer. \n",
    "\n",
    "- each step in this pipeline (i.e., each transformer) can ultimately be seen in itself as being composed of other, smaller transformers. This gives us a pattern that can be used to guide the implementation of transformers\n",
    "\n",
    "- simple implementation in rubix.pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "## Restrictions\n",
    "- jax is pure functional. Anything that needs to be transformed with jax has to be a pure function. \n",
    "Any stuff that comes from the environment must be explicitly copied into the function or be bound to it such that the internal state is of the function is self-contained. \n",
    "\n",
    "- It's irrelevant what builds these pure functions. Therefore, we use a factory pattern to do all configuration work like reading files, pulling stuff from the net, providing any function arguments to be used in the pipeline and so on. A factory then produces a pure function that contains all the data we need as static arguments and retains only the stuff it computes on as tracable arguments. \n",
    "\n",
    "- we can leverage [`jax.tree_util.Partial`](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.tree_util.Partial.html) for this, which works like `functools.partial` but is compatible with jax transformations. Note that stateful objects can still be used internally as long as no stuff from an outer scope (that may change over time) is read or written. This is the user's responsibility \n"
